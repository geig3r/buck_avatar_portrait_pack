Avatar Planning

how to lock skin color for various body parts.  We'll pass the skin type and have a flag that locks it. 
Maybe an array of the locked types.  

if type == skin_lockedd then check for the last set skintone of those types. Maybe store it as soon 
as one of the locked is changed.  


Need to lock skill tone
Need to lock torso and clothes based upon fem/masc
Blendmode or shader effects for some things
