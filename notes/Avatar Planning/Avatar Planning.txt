Avatar Planning


We'll need an avatar system constructor because we'll want to use the avatar system to draw avatars.

This system will handly only the drawing, but take input from other system like the selector
and a token? string code that you can copy/paste to use as an avatar preset.
Basically a coded string that represents the avatar options
Figure out a sytem that you can use for all layers or only some, like having preset outfits
torso/hat/glasses, but everything else isn't pre-defined.  So we can eventually have outfit selectors/presets.




We'll have the avatar selector be optional and separately defined 
avatar_system.has_selector
avatar_system.selector_x/y

Set up the avatar selector to carry all of the locking and options.


















how to lock skin color for various body parts.  We'll pass the skin type and have a flag that locks it. 
Maybe an array of the locked types.  

if type == skin_lockedd then check for the last set skintone of those types. Maybe store it as soon 
as one of the locked is changed.  


Need to lock skill tone
Need to lock torso and clothes based upon fem/masc
Blendmode or shader effects for some things

Because all of these elements have the same parent, we can search through all of them to see if
share the same lock list var as whichever element is being changed.
